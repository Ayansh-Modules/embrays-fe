      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the vast expanse of the cosmos, &lt;code&gt;there&lt;/code&gt; are few objects as mysterious and awe-inspiring as black holes. These enigmatic cosmic phenomena, once thought of as nothing more than theoretical curiosities, have now become a central focus of astronomical research. In this article, we embark on a journey deep into the heart of darkness, unraveling some of the secrets that lie within.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;black-holes-what-and-why&#34;&gt;Black Holes: What and Why?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before delving deeper, let&amp;rsquo;s understand what a black hole actually is. Black holes are the remnants of massive stars that have undergone a supernova explosion. When these stars collapse under their own gravity, they become incredibly dense, with gravity so strong that not even light can escape their grasp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
